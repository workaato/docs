# Connectors

Workato connectors secure access to your business applications. Each connector includes authentication methods, triggers, and actions for its specific target app.

The Workato platform has over a thousand connectors. To view all supported connectors or search by category, visit [Our app integrations](https://www.workato.com/integrations).


We recommend that you reference our video channel for instructions on "How to create a new app connection":

We have support documentation for our most popular connectors. These [Pre-built connectors](/connectors/prebuilt-connectors.md) cover the basics:
- How to connect the app
- Roles and permissions required to establish a connection
- Triggers
- Actions
- Troubleshooting common errors

You also have access to the Workato community library, where other users share their custom connectors. 
See [Community connectors](/developing-connectors/community/community.md).
