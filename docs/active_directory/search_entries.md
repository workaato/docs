    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Entry search filter</td>
      <td>
        Use this to filter the entries to be processed by this trigger. This is similar to <b>Search by</b>. However, this allows you to use LDAP syntax to perform more complex conditionals. Use this input if you need to filter using compound conditionals or nested conditionals.<br><br>
        For example, use <code>&(ou=Dev)(objectClass=Person)</code> to pick up only <b>Person</b> entries from the <b>Dev</b> organization unit.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Output fields
