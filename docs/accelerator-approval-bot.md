Today's managers are bombarded with emails and notifications of approval requests from a multitude of applications, many of which have their own approval workflows. This leads to challenges in accessing, locating, and approving these requests. 

The **Approval bot accelerator** reduces the effort of logging into multiple applications to approve or deny approval requests. It also reduces development resources required to create Slack or MS Teams actions and Workato recipes to route approval requests from multiple applications. This enables your team to focus on building basic business logic. 

The Approval Bot accelerator provides your team with pre-built Slack or MS Teams bots. These bots automatically consolidate approval requests from different applications in a centralized messaging platform of your choice (Slack or MS Teams). Here, the approvers you designate process requests.

We designed this accelerator to have out-of-the-box capabilities to work with a workflow triggered from a new or updated row in Google sheets. You can [customize the recipe trigger](accelerator-approval-bot-customize-slack.md) by supplementing an app of your choice to suit your approval workflow.

The Approval bot has a flexible framework, enabling you to customize which applications to include in approval requests.
